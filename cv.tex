\begin{itemize}[nosep, after=\strut, leftmargin=*]
\footnotesize{
\item As Director, I am continuing building on our suite of Home page and PDP personalization and also expanding my scope.
\item I extended into new work with Search, Marketing, and Merchandizing, and increased leadership to a team of 12.
\item I have completed multiple Generative AI projects to expand data sources and support our existing models.
\item As the acting Vice President, I am also actively assessing 3-5 year plans and presenting in Steering Committee meetings.}

& Sr. Manager of Data Science, Personalization and Recommendations\\
& \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}[nosep, after=\strut, leftmargin=*]
\footnotesize{
\item As Senior Manager with a smaller team of only 3, I have been able to drive total lifts of more than 3\% in hours and 1\% in streaming days during AB tests, contributing to tens of millions in incremental ad and subscriber revenue.
\item We have built graph neural network solutions, time-series models, fully connected transformer models, NLP embeddings, and Reinforcement Learning solutions to support the creation of the over 20 models that now support the entire global suite under NBCU: Peacock, Sky Showtime, and Showmax.
\item We created an application for executives, editors, and product teams to explain and visualize our models for transparency.}

\textsc{Lowe's} & Sr. Manager of Data Science and Analytics\\
\textsc{2015 - 2022} & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}[nosep, after=\strut, leftmargin=*]
\footnotesize{
\item With a team of 17 in the U.S. and Bangalore, I expanded on our solutions for freight, space, and assortment optimization.
\item We developed an internal tool that gave merchants the power to estimate profit and margin of any item assortment in any set of stores, providing a way to negotiate with vendors and make the best decisions on what to stock in every store.
\item Our assortment planning work led to 2x in merchandising productivity with an incredibly efficient deep neural net model visualized via a UX-optimized React application layer.
\item Later, I led an ML platform team, building SSO-integrated MLFlow, easier database utilities, and created an automated outlier detection mechanism employing a novel technique of multi-modelling to create a powerful meta-algorithm.}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\\
\\
& Principal Data Scientist\\
& \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}[nosep, after=\strut, leftmargin=*]
\footnotesize{
\item As Principal, I led and contributed with 4 people to deliver demand prediction neural net model rivaling IBM and SAS models in place at the time, with the capability of learning with pricing, promotion, freight, space, and assortment.
\item I created a vendor freight optimization tool and a space optimization tool, together driving measured incremental value in the hundreds of millions and just under a billion for margin and revenue respectively.
\item I ran SQL, Cloud and Agile process training for the entire department of over 100 data scientists, analysts, and engineers.}

\\
& Senior Data Scientist\\
& \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}[nosep, after=\strut, leftmargin=*]
\footnotesize{
\item As Senior, I built 30 more models, tested with a further lift of 13\%, leading to hundreds of millions in incremental revenue.
\item I focused on automation and helped hire and train new people to take over my models in recs and personalization.
\item I expanded into Lowe's first projects in merchandising, marketing, and store operations, working as a one-man startup.
\item We hired 80 data scientists to expand on the projects I started and sold to internal stakeholders during this time.}

\\
& Data Scientist\\
& \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}[nosep, after=\strut, leftmargin=*]
\footnotesize{
\item As the first data scientist at Lowe's, my first model won an AB test against Adobe with a 250\% lift in incremental revenue.
\item I reduced cost by \$7 million/year after ending a contract and my success led to us expanding our data science program.
\item I built 20 more models to support the home page, search, and product detail pages, driving 15\% lift in new surfaces.}

%techniques for remote telescopes, having observed many nights on the Chilean 4.1m SOAR telescope, and also completing reduction of these data. I have helped to create and calibrate a new multi-slit spectrum slicer for the GOODMAN spectrograph that is now an active instrument. I have examined correlations between the photometric properties of galaxies and differences in kinematic and photometric inclinations, presenting results at AAS 2015 in Seattle, WA. I have created a code that fits velocity field data to functions defined by Courteau.}\\
%using all known documentation for each burst available on the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System, which provides information about magnitudes in different bands as a function of time after the burst, over a wide swathe of types of bursts. My work involved data mining ADS for the creation of a MySQL server, with much more easily accessible data, creating new opportunities in a more complete analysis of GRB afterglows using all available public data. The database will be made public when completed.}\\

\textsc{Academia} & Astrophysicist, \emph{NC Astronomy Research Center \& UNC Astronomy}\\
\textsc{2012 - 2015} & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}[nosep, after=\strut, leftmargin=*]
\footnotesize{
\item With Dr. Sheila Kannappan, I ran dynamic observation, processed raw telescope data in Python and Fortran, and ran imaging for the 4.1-meter Chilean SOAR telescope, focusing on \href{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AAS...22533611B/abstract}{determination of 3D galaxy movement from 2D projections}.

\item With Dr. Dan Reichart, I worked on cataloging the largest database for Gamma Ray Burst afterglows, writing updates to a SQL database. In addition, I was a teaching assistant for the Introductory Astronomy course at UNC.

\item With Dr. Patrick Treuthardt, I determined \href{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22345312T/abstract}{relationships between galactic dust lane structure, axial ratios and pattern speeds}, analyzing data on large screens where museum patrons could watch and ask questions. We were featured in Wired and CNN after I discovered \href{https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-discovered-a-brand-new-type-of-galaxy}{the first Double Hoag's galaxy}. In addition, we ran interactive H-Alpha telescope sessions for patrons to safely observe the sun.}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\\
%I began by designing informative videos for patrons of the Museum of Natural Science, then joined Dr. Patrick Treuthardt in completing research on the formation and curvature of dust lanes in barred spiral galaxies, with galaxies selected based on resolutions and pattern speeds from a previous paper. Answering questions about astrophysical phenomena and conducting H$\alpha$ sun observations on the roof were also a part of daily work. My research involved using IRAF and DS9 to correct over 40 galaxies for inclination, and creating B-R color index maps for each to intensify the dust features. The preliminary results were presented at AAS 2014 (details \textbf{\href{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22345312T}{here}}).}\\

%Also, many small grants and scholarships that I have applied for I have heard about from intellectual patrons visiting for local conferences, or regulars teaching at local universities.}
