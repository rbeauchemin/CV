Astronomy Research Center / RESOLVE Galaxy Survey / UNC Astronomy
Research Assistant
2013 - 2015

Responsibilities As a part of the RESOLVE team under Dr. Sheila Kannappan, I have been trained in dynamic observation, reduction of data, and instrumentation for the 4.1-meter Chilean SOAR telescope, and my research involved determination of three dimensional information from two dimensional projections.

In Dr. Dan Reichart's group, I helped in the creation of the largest database for Gamma Ray Burst afterglows, working heavily with spreadsheets and data manipulation in a massive SQL database. I was also an assistant in the lab component of the Introductory Astronomy course at UNC.

Responsibilities I designed informative videos using iMovie and Keynote, gave presentations on solar phenomena with an H-alpha filtered solar telescope, and developed tools to determine intrinsic properties of spiral galaxies.

In 2017, our team was featured with an image I took of the first discovered double Hoag's galaxy. See link: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/new-hoag-type-galaxy-discovered


Lowe's
Data Scientist / Web Analyst
2015 - 2017

Starting with just 3 analysts in Lowes’ digital team, I wanted to beat Adobe with my own algorithms utilizing product and user data to create personalized recommendations. I trained models on orders, cart additions, views and revenue to optimize the experience. This work beat Adobe by 250% in incremental revenue, allowing us to end a $7M contract and make the case for data science at Lowe’s.

Then, I officially joined Lowe's and had the opportunity to interview and hire to start building the data science practice at Lowe’s that was created in Feb 2017. During this time, I also automated product recommendations algorithms bringing a 13% improvement recommendations visibility with hundreds of millions in incremental revenue tested in an A/B framework. During this time we had a shift to focus on both digital and the rest of the enterprise. The enterprise shift led us to open many new connections and work on projects across new organizations.

Lowe's
Senior Data Scientist
2017 - 2019

As a senior, I had the opportunity to form the Data Science team responsible for recommendations and personalization to take over my
previous work. I learned and shared knowledge with the entire Data Science group on Agile methodology and cloud-based systems to align with modern practices, being one of the first to join the cloud at Lowe's Data Science. I also finalized transitioning algorithms originally required to be created in Alteryx into a more scalable and sustainable SQL, before starting a new team in merchandising that would start tackling what is essentially recommendations for brick-and-mortar retail.

Lowe's
Principal Data Scientist
2019 - 2020

As principal, my main goal was to get a set of data driven utilities ready for various aspects of the merchandising community at Lowe’s.
With only four people, we were able to complete the first version of a demand model and expand the team to continue work on this tool, as well as a vendor freight optimization tool and a space optimization tool, driving more than $10M in incremental margin, with a potential of $1B in incremental revenue, not yet tested.

Sr Manager Data Science (& Software Engineering)
2020 - 2022

I was responsible for the global Data Science team for Merchandising at Lowe’s, a team of 17 in the US and Bangalore, creating the Clustering and Assortment Planning Suite (CAPS) and the Space Optimization Kit (SPOK). These applications and the support we provide for them drives 2x in merchandising productivity with incredible insights from our complex deep neural net models explained simply in a UX-driven React application layer.

More recently, I have joined the Platform team and taken the role of Sr SWE Manager, still leading a Data Science group, to build out autonomous Anomaly Detection for Data Scientists across Lowe's. This employs a novel technique of multi-modelling to create a powerful meta-algorithm capable of finding hard to detect anomalies.
